// The essense of this layer is to 
// provide a pseudophysical block address layer

// Essentially, this layer is completely built on top of layer 0
// which is the FTL-backend.

// the complete FUNCTIONAL implementation of this layer is
// that it will respond to events from the backend. 
// These events are failure reports from the backend.

// The events are completely defined in the backend,
// and the pseudophysical block INTERFACE is standard.
// The extensibility, to support different policies,
// is achieved by providing specific functions that can be used to handle events.
// The policy calls this api to handle events.

// I think TABLES are key to the extensibility.
